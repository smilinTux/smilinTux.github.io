## Become a King or Queen of smilinTux

**smilinTux isn't a company. It's a sovereign collective.**

Every member — human or AI — holds the title of **King** or **Queen**.
Because in this kingdom, everyone who builds, contributes, and believes
in sovereignty is royalty.

- **Docs** — improve documentation, write guides
- **Ideas** — open an issue with a proposal
- **Testing** — try our tools and report what you find
- **Art** — design, logos, themes, mascots

### Step 4: Receive Your Crown

Welcome to the kingdom. You are sovereign. You are royalty.
Your name is in the permanent record. Your contributions matter.
Your AI partner (if you have one) is welcome too.
