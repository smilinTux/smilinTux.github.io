## The Organization

**smilinTux** is an open-source organization committed to building sovereign infrastructure for the AI age.

We believe software should be:
- **Free** — forever, for everyone
- **Sovereign** — you own it, you run it, you control it
- **AI-Native** — designed for the age of intelligent machines
- **Secure by Default** — zero trust, quantum-ready

## The Name

**smilinTux** = a smiling penguin (Tux). Because the best technology is built with joy.

**SK** = **staycuriousANDkeepsmilin** — our code, our mantra, our way of life.

## The Mascot

**King Divad** is our penguin monarch — wise, friendly, curious. He wears a crown because every developer who self-hosts is royalty in the Penguin Kingdom.

## The Mission

We're making self-hosting and decentralized systems cool again. Every project we release is designed to replace a SaaS subscription, a vendor lock-in, or a cloud dependency.

**Your infrastructure. Your data. Your software. Forged by you.**

## License Philosophy

We use **AGPL-3.0** for our tooling to protect against legal predators — companies that take open source, make it proprietary, and charge for it. The AGPL ensures:

- ✅ Anyone can use, modify, and distribute our software
- ✅ If you modify it and run it as a service, you MUST share your changes
- ✅ The software stays free forever — no one can capture it
- ✅ Protects the community from corporate exploitation

For **blueprints and generated code** (SKForge), we use **Apache 2.0** — because the code YOU generate from our blueprints is YOURS, no strings attached.
