## 🔧 Don't use software. Forge your own.

**Forgeprint** provides AI-native software blueprints — detailed specification files that any LLM can consume to generate complete, working, tested software products.

### Install

```bash
npm install -g forgeprint
forge onboard
```

### Quick Start

```bash
forge init load-balancers    # Pick a blueprint
# Edit driver.md features
forge build                  # AI generates your code
```

### How It Works

1. **Pick a Blueprint** — Load balancers, databases, web servers, and 25+ categories
2. **Choose Your Features** — Select from exhaustive, community-maintained checklists
3. **Select Your Language** — Rust, Go, Python, Java, TypeScript, .NET, Zig
4. **Forge It** — Any AI reads your config + blueprint specs → generates complete software

### Why Forgeprint?

- **Kill SaaS subscriptions** — Forge your own Datadog, Auth0, Algolia
- **No bloat** — Only the features YOU choose
- **Language agnostic** — Same blueprint, any language
- **Test-driven** — Every blueprint includes test specs
- **Community-driven** — 400+ features researched across 100+ products
- **Free forever** — Apache 2.0 for blueprints, AGPL-3.0 for tooling
